## Design
At the Recipe Collective, the design philosophy revolves around creating a clean and modern user interface that puts the spotlight on the recipes themselves. Taking inspiration from modern home kitchens, the aim is to provide a visually pleasing and immersive experience for users, where they can easily navigate, discover, and engage with a vast collection of recipes.

By adopting a minimalistic design approach, we strive to eliminate distractions and ensure that the focus remains on the culinary creations shared within the community. The use of ample white space, intuitive layouts, and crisp typography enhances readability and allows the vibrant colors and mouthwatering imagery of the recipes to take center stage.

### Design Choices
One of the key design choices we made was to prioritize a light and clean aesthetic throughout the Recipe Collective. This deliberate approach aims to enhance the presentation of recipe images and create an inviting atmosphere for users to immerse themselves in the content. To achieve this, I meticulously curated a color scheme that exudes freshness while incorporating subtle hints of color that resonate with the culinary nature of our application.

### Colour
One of the key design choices we made was to keep the overall aesthetic light and clean. This approach enhances the recipe images and creates an inviting atmosphere for users to explore and engage with the content. We carefully selected a color scheme that evokes a sense of freshness with a tiny bit of color to reflect the culinary nature of our application.

![Mockup image](/docs/color-palette.png)

The Recipe Collective embraces the default fonts provided by Bootsrap 5. No specific modifications have been made to the default fonts, as they effectively contribute to the overall aesthetic and user experience of the Recipe Collective.

## Methodology
The Recipe Collective project has been developed using agile principles, enabling efficient collaboration, iterative development, and effective project management. The following methodology has been employed throughout the project:

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
GitHub Projects has been utilized to facilitate agile project management. User stories and bugs have been organized as GitHub issues, allowing for a clear and structured approach to development. The project board in GitHub Projects serves as a Kanban board, providing an overview of the project's progress.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Each user story has been created as a GitHub issue, capturing the desired functionality from the user's perspective. The user stories are linked to their corresponding GitHub issues, allowing easy access to the acceptance criteria, tasks, and comments associated with each user story.

### Bug Tracking
Bugs encountered during the development process have also been logged as GitHub issues. These issues contain details about the specific bug, its impact, and steps to reproduce it. By linking the bugs in the README.md to their respective GitHub issues, users can gain insights into the bugs' resolution progress and view any additional comments.

### Iterative Development Approach
The Recipe Collective project adopts an iterative development approach, allowing for continuous improvement and progress within the given time constraints. Although the project timeline has been condensed, it has been structured to accommodate future iterations and enhancements.

### Backlog and Subsequent Iterations 
The user stories are tracked on the project board, and the "To do" column represents the backlog of user stories, indicating the tasks that will be addressed in subsequent iterations.

Please note that even though the project timeline has been accelerated, the iterative development approach allows for ongoing improvements and enhancements to meet the evolving needs of users.

For a comprehensive view of the project progress, user stories, and bug tracking, please see the [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/SandraBergstrom/projects/6).

## Deployment
The website was deployed using Heroku by following these steps:
1. Set DEBUG to False in the settings.py file.
2. Commit and push your code to the GitHub repository.
3. Clear the 'static' folder in Cloudinary to ensure the latest static files are used during deployment. This step is important to avoid any potential conflicts between cached versions of static files and the updated versions being deployed. Clearing the 'static' folder ensures that the latest versions of static files are used during the deployment process, preventing any eTag errors or inconsistencies.
4. Navigate to the project's deploy page in Heroku.
5. Choose the manual deployment option to deploy the latest code changes.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the following tutorial which provided valuable guidance and inspiration during the development of this project:

[Python Django Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App](https://youtu.be/UmljXZIypDc)  Key Insights:
- User Extension: The tutorial/resource explained how to create a custom user model that extends the default Django user model. It provided insights into adding additional fields to the user model, such as profile image, food relation, and country, allowing for more personalized user profiles.
- User Registration: I learned how to implement a user registration view using the UserCreationForm and handling form validation. The tutorial/resource also demonstrated how to display success messages upon successful registration.
- Profile Management: The tutorial/resource guided me through the process of creating views for profile editing and updating. It covered the usage of ModelForms and handling form submissions, including updating the user model and associated profile data.
- Authentication and Authorization: I gained a better understanding of implementing login and logout views using Django's built-in authentication system. The tutorial/resource explained how to leverage the authentication system's features for secure user authentication and authorization.
- Recipe-related Views: Additionally, the tutorial provided insights into creating views for managing recipes.

I am grateful for the creators of the tutorial for their efforts in creating a helpful learning material.

I would like to express my gratitude and extend my thanks to the following individuals who have been instrumental in my journey:
- Jubril Akolade, my mentor, for his invaluable feedback, advice, guidance, and support throughout this experience.
- Paul Thomas O'Riordan, our cohort facilitator, for his dedication and weekly meetings where he has provided guidance, support, and encouragement to our cohort.
- The wonderful members of the Code Institute Slack community for their willingness to provide peer code reviews and support.

I am truly grateful for their contributions, which have greatly enriched my learning and development.
