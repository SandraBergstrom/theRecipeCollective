## Deployment
The website was deployed using Heroku by following these steps:
1. Set DEBUG to False in the settings.py file.
2. Commit and push your code to the GitHub repository.
3. Clear the 'static' folder in Cloudinary to ensure the latest static files are used during deployment. This step is important to avoid any potential conflicts between cached versions of static files and the updated versions being deployed. Clearing the 'static' folder ensures that the latest versions of static files are used during the deployment process, preventing any eTag errors or inconsistencies.
4. Navigate to the project's deploy page in Heroku.
5. Choose the manual deployment option to deploy the latest code changes.

You can for fork the repository by following these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on Fork button in upper right hand corner
3. Wait for the forking process to complete. Once done, you will have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

You can clone the repository by following these steps:
1. Go to the GitHub repository 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select your preferred method for cloning: HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI, and click the copy button to copy the repository URL to your clipboard.
4. Open Git Bash (or your preferred terminal).
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
6. Type the command **'git clone'** followed by the URL you copied in step 3. The command should look like this: **git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY**.
7.Press Enter to create your local clone.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the following tutorial which provided valuable guidance and inspiration during the development of this project:

[Python Django Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App](https://youtu.be/UmljXZIypDc)  Key Insights:
