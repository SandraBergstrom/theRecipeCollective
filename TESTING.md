### HTML Validation
[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) is a service provided by the W3C that allows you to validate your HTML code against the official specifications. It checks for syntax errors, improper tag usage, and other issues that may affect the structure and semantics of your web pages. Validating your HTML code with W3C Markup Validation helps ensure that your pages are well-formed and adhere to web standards

All pages passed through the validation and the code was pasted in and I used a filter to remove issues related to the Django templating system. <details><summary>See filter</summary>![Result](/docs/validation/html/filter.png)</details>

### CSS Validation
[W3C Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) is a tool provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows you to validate and check the correctness of your HTML and CSS code. It helps ensure that your web pages comply with the standards set by the W3C, promoting interoperability and accessibility.

### Python Validation 
[PEP 8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) is a style guide for writing Python code to ensure consistency and readability. It provides guidelines on how to format code, naming conventions for variables and functions, and other best practices. Following PEP 8 helps to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.

The settings file had one URL that was too long, while the other lines exceeding the recommended length were automatically generated by Django.All other files had no errors and were clear of any issues.

Note: The specific details and validation results for each file can be viewed by expanding the corresponding sections.

### Accessibility
[The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to assess the accessibility of the website. WAVE helps identify potential accessibility issues and provides guidance on how to improve the accessibility of web content.

During the evaluation, the following issues were identified:

- Errors: The website generated 5 errors, which are related to the Bootstrap footer. 

- Contrast Warning: I received a contrast warning for my primary button, which has white text against a brownish background. It's worth noting that I intentionally chose this design with white text, as it aligns with my overall aesthetic and branding. While I understand that using black text for better readability on the button, I have decided to maintain the white text as a deliberate design choice.

- Redundant Link Alert: The tool flagged one alert for a redundant link. This alert is due to the tool misinterpreting the {{}} inserted URL pages, mistakenly assuming they are duplicate links. I want to clarify that these links are not going to the same place. This alert does not impact the functionality or accessibility of my website.

By using the WAVE tool, I gained valuable insights into the accessibility of my website. While I have chosen not to address certain errors at this time, I remain committed to creating an inclusive user experience and will continue to explore ways to improve accessibility in the future.
